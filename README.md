# Taiwan payments
This report describes the approach used to predict the default payments made by customers in Taiwan
during April-September 2005, by implementing a Neural Network model. The dataset consists of three
‘.csv’ files including the training sets and test set, where the validation will be executed. In order to
make the prediction, it is recommended to do some data exploration of the features available to the
dataset. It is worth to mention that irrelevant data can be found, so it is recommended to apply some
simple preprocessing 1 . Also, the source code is written in a Python Notebook, using Visual Studio Code
as main editor but any other editor can be used. We will see in details as follows in the next sections.
